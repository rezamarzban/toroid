## Solve this:

**Capacitor discharge equation:**  
$$V_{\text{out}} = V_0 e^{-t/(RC)}$$

**MOSFET drain current in saturation mode:**  
$$I_d = K(V_{gs} - V_{th})^2$$

**Inductor spike voltage during cutoff:**  
$$V_{\text{spike}} = L \frac{di}{dt}$$

Put $V_{gs} = V_{\text{out}}$

Put $i$ in the $V_{\text{spike}}$ equation equal to $I_d$

Now solve equations to retrieve $V_{\text{spike}}$

---

To solve for $V_{\text{spike}}$, we combine the given equations step by step:

1. **Capacitor Discharge Voltage**:  
   $$V_{\text{out}} = V_0 e^{-t/(RC)}$$

2. **MOSFET Drain Current in Saturation**:  
   Substitute $V_{gs} = V_{\text{out}}$:  
   $$I_d = K(V_{\text{out}} - V_{\text{th}})^2 = K\left(V_0 e^{-t/(RC)} - V_{\text{th}}\right)^2$$

3. **Inductor Spike Voltage**:  
   Substitute $i = I_d$ into $V_{\text{spike}} = L \frac{di}{dt}$:  
   $$V_{\text{spike}} = L \frac{d}{dt} \left[ K\left(V_0 e^{-t/(RC)} - V_{\text{th}}\right)^2 \right]$$

4. **Differentiate $I_d$ with Respect to Time**:  
   Apply the chain rule:  
   $$\frac{dI_d}{dt} = 2K\left(V_0 e^{-t/(RC)} - V_{\text{th}}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{V_0}{RC} e^{-t/(RC)}\right)$$

5. **Final Expression for $V_{\text{spike}}$**:  
   Multiply by $L$:  
   $$V_{\text{spike}} = -\frac{2KL V_0}{RC} e^{-t/(RC)} \left(V_0 e^{-t/(RC)} - V_{\text{th}}\right)$$

### Key Observations:
- The voltage spike depends on time $t$, with exponential decay terms $e^{-t/(RC)}$.
- The negative sign indicates a polarity inversion due to the inductor opposing the current change (Lenz’s Law).
- The spike magnitude diminishes as $V_{\text{out}}$ approaches $V_{\text{th}}$, where the MOSFET turns off ($I_d \to 0$).

### Final Answer:
$$V_{\text{spike}} = -\frac{2KL V_0}{RC} e^{-t/(RC)} \left(V_0 e^{-t/(RC)} - V_{\text{th}}\right)$$

## Solve earlier final expression for $V_{\text{spike}}$ while limit $t = 0$

To solve for $V_{\text{spike}}$ as $t \to 0$, substitute $t = 0$ into the derived expression:  
$$V_{\text{spike}} = -\frac{2KL V_0}{RC} e^{-t/(RC)} \left(V_0 e^{-t/(RC)} - V_{\text{th}}\right)$$  
At $t = 0$, $e^{-0/(RC)} = 1$. Substituting this:  
$$V_{\text{spike}} = -\frac{2KL V_0}{RC} \cdot 1 \cdot (V_0 - V_{\text{th}}) = -\frac{2KL V_0 (V_0 - V_{\text{th}})}{RC}$$  

### Key Notes:
- The negative sign indicates a polarity inversion due to the inductor opposing the sudden current change, consistent with Lenz’s Law.
- The magnitude depends on the initial voltage $V_0$, threshold voltage $V_{\text{th}}$, and circuit parameters $R, C, L, K$.
- If $V_0 = V_{\text{th}}$, the spike voltage becomes zero, as expected (MOSFET stops conducting).  

### Final Answer:
$$\lim_{t \to 0} V_{\text{spike}} = -\frac{2KL V_0 (V_0 - V_{\text{th}})}{RC}$$
