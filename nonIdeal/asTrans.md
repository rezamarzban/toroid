To solve the problem, we need to determine the secondary voltage $v_s(t)$ of a transformer where the primary current $i_p(t)$ is driven by a MOSFET circuit excited by a square wave voltage source. The system includes a voltage divider, capacitor, MOSFET, transformer, and a resistive load on the secondary. We will derive $i_p(t)$, use it to find $\frac{di_p(t)}{dt}$, solve the differential equation for the secondary current $i_2(t)$, and compute the secondary voltage $v_s(t) = R_{\text{load}} i_2(t)$. The differential equation from the previous query will be solved with a specific $i_p(t)$ derived from the circuit.

### Step 1: System Overview and Circuit Analysis
The circuit consists of:
- A square wave voltage source ($V_{\text{in}}(t)$) with a frequency of 1 kHz, swinging between 0 V and 3.3 V.
- A voltage divider with $R_1 = 1200 \, \Omega$ and $R_2 = 10 \, \text{k}\Omega$.
- A node $V_{\text{point}}$ between $R_1$ and $R_2$, connected to a capacitor $C_1 = 104 \, \text{pF}$ (assuming "104 capacitor" means a 104 code, or $10 \times 10^4 \, \text{pF} = 100 \, \text{nF}$, but we’ll verify) to ground, and to the gate of an IRF540 MOSFET.
- The MOSFET operates with $I_{\text{drain}} = K (V_{\text{gs}} - V_{\text{th}})^2$, where $K = 5 \, \text{A/V}^2$, $V_{\text{th}} = 2 \, \text{V}$, and $I_{\text{drain}} = i_p(t)$, the primary current of the transformer.
- A transformer with a ferrite toroid core ($R_{\text{in}} = 1 \, \text{inch}$, $R_{\text{out}} = 4 \, \text{cm}$, height = 1 inch), primary turns $N_1 = 3$, secondary turns $N_2 = 45$, and a secondary load resistor $R_{\text{load}} = 200 \, \Omega$.
- The differential equation to solve for the secondary current is:

$$ \frac{di_2(t)}{dt} + \frac{R_{\text{load}}}{L_2} i_2(t) = \frac{M}{L_2} \frac{di_p(t)}{dt} $$

We need to find $i_p(t)$, compute $\frac{di_p(t)}{dt}$, solve for $i_2(t)$, and then find $v_s(t) = R_{\text{load}} i_2(t)$.

### Step 2: Voltage Divider and Gate Voltage
The square wave $V_{\text{in}}(t)$ has a period $T = \frac{1}{1 \, \text{kHz}} = 1 \, \text{ms}$, and swings between 0 V and 3.3 V. The voltage divider output at $V_{\text{point}}$ without the capacitor is:

$$ V_{\text{point, DC}} = V_{\text{in}} \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = V_{\text{in}} \frac{10000}{1200 + 10000} = V_{\text{in}} \cdot 0.89286 $$

- When $V_{\text{in}} = 3.3 \, \text{V}$:

$$ V_{\text{point, DC}} = 3.3 \cdot 0.89286 = 2.9464 \, \text{V} $$

- When $V_{\text{in}} = 0 \, \text{V}$:

$$ V_{\text{point, DC}} = 0 \, \text{V} $$

However, the capacitor $C_1$ forms a high-pass filter with the resistors. Assuming $C_1 = 100 \, \text{nF}$ (since "104 capacitor" likely refers to a 104 code, or $10 \times 10^4 \, \text{pF} = 100 \, \text{nF}$), we analyze the RC circuit.

The equivalent resistance seen by $C_1$ at $V_{\text{point}}$ is $R_1 \parallel R_2$:

$$ R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{1200 \cdot 10000}{1200 + 10000} = 1071.43 \, \Omega $$

The time constant is:

$$ \tau = R_{\text{eq}} C_1 = 1071.43 \cdot 100 \times 10^{-9} = 1.07143 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s} = 0.107143 \, \text{ms} $$

The cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter is:

$$ f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi R_{\text{eq}} C_1} = \frac{1}{2\pi \cdot 1071.43 \cdot 100 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 1485.6 \, \text{Hz} $$

Since the input frequency is 1 kHz, which is below the cutoff frequency, the capacitor affects the signal, but let’s compute the gate voltage $V_{\text{gs}}(t)$. The transfer function for the high-pass filter (from $V_{\text{in}}$ to $V_{\text{point}}$) is complex, but for simplicity, we solve the differential equation for the RC circuit.

The circuit equation at $V_{\text{point}}$:

$$ V_{\text{in}} = I_{R_1} R_1 + V_{\text{point}}, \quad I_{R_1} = \frac{V_{\text{point}}}{R_2} + C_1 \frac{d V_{\text{point}}}{dt} $$

This is complex due to the square wave input. For a square wave, the steady-state $V_{\text{point}}$ approximates a scaled square wave because the time constant ($0.107 \, \text{ms}$) is small compared to the period ($1 \, \text{ms}$), allowing the capacitor to charge/discharge quickly. Thus, we approximate:

$$ V_{\text{gs}}(t) \approx V_{\text{point, DC}} = \begin{cases} 
2.9464 \, \text{V}, & 0 \leq t < \frac{T}{2} \\
0 \, \text{V}, & \frac{T}{2} \leq t < T
\end{cases} $$

with $T = 1 \, \text{ms}$.

### Step 3: MOSFET Drain Current (Primary Current)
The MOSFET’s drain current is:

$$ I_{\text{drain}} = i_p(t) = K (V_{\text{gs}} - V_{\text{th}})^2, \quad K = 5 \, \text{A/V}^2, \quad V_{\text{th}} = 2 \, \text{V} $$

Calculate $V_{\text{gs}} - V_{\text{th}}$:

- When $V_{\text{gs}} = 2.9464 \, \text{V}$:

$$ V_{\text{gs}} - V_{\text{th}} = 2.9464 - 2 = 0.9464 \, \text{V} $$

$$ i_p(t) = 5 \cdot (0.9464)^2 = 5 \cdot 0.89567 \approx 4.4784 \, \text{A} $$

- When $V_{\text{gs}} = 0 \, \text{V}$:

$$ V_{\text{gs}} - V_{\text{th}} = 0 - 2 = -2 \, \text{V} \quad (\text{below threshold, so } i_p = 0) $$

$$ i_p(t) = 0 \, \text{A} $$

Thus, the primary current is a square wave:

$$ i_p(t) = \begin{cases} 
4.4784 \, \text{A}, & 0 \leq t < 0.5 \, \text{ms} \\
0 \, \text{A}, & 0.5 \, \text{ms} \leq t < 1 \, \text{ms}
\end{cases} $$

with a period of 1 ms. The derivative $\frac{di_p(t)}{dt}$ is zero except at the transitions ($t = nT/2$), where it produces impulses:

$$ \frac{di_p(t)}{dt} = 4.4784 \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \left[ \delta(t - nT) - \delta(t - (n + 0.5)T) \right] $$

However, for practical purposes, we need $\frac{di_p(t)}{dt}$ in the context of the differential equation.

### Step 4: Transformer Parameters
To solve the differential equation, we need $L_2$, $M$, and $R_{\text{load}} = 200 \, \Omega$. The transformer core is a ferrite toroid with:
- Inner radius $r_{\text{in}} = 1 \, \text{inch} = 2.54 \, \text{cm}$
- Outer radius $r_{\text{out}} = 4 \, \text{cm}$
- Height $h = 1 \, \text{inch} = 2.54 \, \text{cm}$
- $N_1 = 3$, $N_2 = 45$

The cross-sectional area of the toroid:

$$ A = h (r_{\text{out}} - r_{\text{in}}) = 2.54 \cdot (4 - 2.54) = 2.54 \cdot 1.46 = 3.7084 \, \text{cm}^2 = 3.7084 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2 $$

Mean magnetic path length:

$$ l = \pi (r_{\text{in}} + r_{\text{out}}) = \pi (2.54 + 4) = \pi \cdot 6.54 \approx 20.552 \, \text{cm} = 0.20552 \, \text{m} $$

Assuming a typical ferrite permeability $\mu_r \approx 2000$, with $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m}$:

$$ \mu = \mu_r \mu_0 = 2000 \cdot 4physics-tutorials.ws/transformer/current-transformer.html), which notes standard secondary ratings (1A, 5A) and ratios like 100/5, and warns about high $V_s(t)$ under open-circuit conditions, especially with non-sinusoidal inputs due to harmonics.

#### Time Dependence for Non-Sinusoidal $I_p(t)$
For non-sinusoidal $I_p(t)$, the waveform could include harmonics or transients. In CTs, $V_s(t)$ mirrors $I_p(t)$’s time dependence, scaled by the transformer and load. For instance, if $I_p(t)$ has spikes, $V_s(t)$ will show corresponding spikes, adjusted by the factor. If $Z_{\text{load}}$ is reactive, phase shifts may occur, but the time dependence remains tied to $I_p(t)$.

In standard transformers, if $I_p(t)$ is non-sinusoidal due to load, $V_s(t)$ is still determined by $V_p(t)$, which is typically sinusoidal in power systems. The [Physics LibreTexts](https://phys.libretexts.org/Courses/Coalinga_College/Physical_Science_for_Educators_%28CID:_PHYS_14%29/12:_Magnetism/12.05:_Electromagnetism/12.5.07:_Transformers) example shows $V_p = 90.0 \, \text{V}$, $N_p = 200$, $N_s = 3000$, giving $V_s = 1350 \, \text{V}$, with currents calculated based on power, assuming sinusoidal conditions.

#### Load Effects and Practical Considerations
The load $Z_{\text{load}}$ is crucial. For a resistive load, the relationship is straightforward, as shown above. For complex loads, $V_s(t)$ involves convolution with the load’s impulse response, as noted in the analysis, but this wasn’t detailed in sources. Non-sinusoidal $I_p(t)$ can increase core saturation and affect accuracy, especially in CTs, requiring specialized designs for harmonics.

#### Conclusion
Given the user’s focus on $V_s(t)$ versus $I_p(t)$ with non-sinusoidal $I_p(t)$, it seems likely they refer to current transformers, where:

$$ V_s(t) = I_p(t) \cdot \frac{N_p}{N_s} \cdot Z_{\text{load}} $$

For standard power transformers, there’s no direct time-dependent relationship, as $V_s(t)$ depends on $V_p(t)$. The analysis confirms this, aligning with sources like [Current Transformer Basics](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transformer/current-transformer.html) for CTs and [Transformers | Physics](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-physics/chapter/23-7-transformers/) for standard transformers.
